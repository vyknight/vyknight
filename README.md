## Hello 

I'm Matthew, a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. Previously, I was a fullstack software development intern for IBM and Onova, and I was also a project intern for UNICEF. 

At IBM, I mainly worked for the IBM Skills Network on our educational labs product, and spent a long time working with technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, IBMCloud, and more. At Onova, I worked on Earth, an all-in-one enterprise hackathon management platform, and PokerGPT, an AI powered poker coach. Additionally, I worked with UNICEF on Djenga, which is a web app helping UNICEF employees world wide assess and select digital public goods, which is things like open source software, datasets, AI models and so on. 

I write code in JavaScript, Python, Java, and C/C++. I also speak English, Chinese, and French.
