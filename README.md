## Hello 

I'm Matthew, a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. I've previously interned at Amazon, Huawei, IBM, and Onova as a software developer.

I specialize in database technologies, but I've also done quite a bit of fullstack web development. Generally I like to keep things simple and to the point.
