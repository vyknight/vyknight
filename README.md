## Hello 

I'm Matthew, a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. I've previously interned for Amazon, Huawei, IBM, and Onova as a software developer.

I specialize in database technologies, but I also do fullstack development. If I get to design something, I usually keep it simple and to the point.
